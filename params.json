The aim of the project is to create corpora that is suitable for machine learning system to recognize establish cell line names from text. The recognized cell line names are normalized linking the names to Cellosaurus identifier.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Gellus and CLL Corpora\r\nWe created two manually annotated corpora, Gellus and CELL. Gellus is suitable for the training any machine learning system in recognizing cell line name mentions. CLL is suitable for evaluating the system in recognizing the Cellosaurus cell line names.\r\n\r\nGellus: (Download link)\r\nCLL: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### Tagged and normalized cell line name documents\r\nWe tagged and normalized cell line names in ~6.7 abstracts + full-text documents in EVEX database. About ~500,000 documents contain at least 1 cell line name. We provided the documents with at least one cell line name tagged in standoff format.\r\n\r\nTagged document: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact me, sukaew@utu.fi for further information of question.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
