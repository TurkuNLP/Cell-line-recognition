The aim of the project is to create corpus that is suitable for machine learning system to recognize and normalize established cell line names from text. \r\n\r\n### Gellus and CLL Corpora\r\nWe created two manually annotated corpora, Gellus and CLL. Gellus is suitable for the training any machine learning system in recognizing cell line name mentions while CLL is suitable for evaluating the system in recognizing the Cellosaurus cell line names.\r\n\r\n* Gellus: (Download link)\r\n* CLL: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### NERsuite model and corpora\r\nWe used NERsuite as our machine learning system trained on Gellus corpus and supplemented with cell line name dictionary. In addition, we provide the derived corpora we used in our studies for those who want to train their own system.\r\n\r\n* NERsuite model: (Download link)\r\n* dictionary: (Download link)\r\n* Gellus corpus split: (Download link)\r\n* JNPBA-CL corpus split: (Download link)\r\n* CellFinder-CL corpus split: (Download link)\r\n  \r\n### Tagged and normalized cell line name documents\r\nWe tagged and normalized cell line names in ~6.7M documents EVEX database, including both PubMed abstracts and PMC-Open Access full text. About 500K documents contain at least one cell line name. We provided the documents and their annotations in standoff format.\r\n\r\n* Tagged documents: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Suwisa Kaewphan, Turku Center for Computer Science (TUCS)\r\n* Sofie Van Landeghem, Gent university\r\n* Tomoko Ohta, Textimi\r\n* Yves Van de Peer, Gent university\r\n* Filip Ginter, University of Turku\r\n* Sampo Pyysalo, University of Turku \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact sukaew@utu.fi or sampo.pyysalo@gmail.com for further information or questions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
