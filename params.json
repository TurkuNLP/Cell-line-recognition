The aim of the project is to create corpus that is suitable for machine learning system to recognize establish cell line names from text. The recognized cell line names are normalized linking the names to Cellosaurus identifier. \r\n\r\n### Gellus and CLL Corpora\r\nWe created two manually annotated corpora, Gellus and CELL. Gellus is suitable for the training any machine learning system in recognizing cell line name mentions. CLL is suitable for evaluating the system in recognizing the Cellosaurus cell line names.\r\n\r\nGellus: (Download link)\r\nCLL: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### NERsuite model and corpora\r\nWe used NERsuite as our machine learning system trained on Gellus corpus supplemented with cell line name dictionary. In addition, we provide the derived corpora we used in our studies for those who want to train their system with alternative choices.\r\n\r\nNERsuite model: (Download link)\r\ndictionary: (Download link)\r\nGellus corpus split: (Download link)\r\nJNPBA-CL corpus split: (Download link)\r\nCellFinder-CL corpus split: (Download link)\r\n  \r\n### Tagged and normalized cell line name documents\r\nWe tagged and normalized cell line names in ~6.7 abstracts + full-text documents in EVEX database. About 500,000 documents contain at least 1 cell line name. We provided the documents with at least one cell line name tagged in standoff format.\r\n\r\nTagged document: (Download link)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSuwisa Kaewphan, Turku Center for Computer Science (TUCS)\r\nSofie Van Landeghem, Gent university\r\nTomoko Ohta, Textimi\r\nYves Van de Peer, Gent university\r\nFilip Ginter, University of Turku\r\nSampo Pyysalo, University of Turku \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact sukaew@utu.fi for further information or questions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
